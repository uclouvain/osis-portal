This documentation explains how to contribute as a committer to OSIS project. A
committer is an individual who is disciplined enough to gain the confidence of
the project manager to commit directly to the repository without further
bureaucracy. In fact, be accepted as a committer is a great recognition of the
quality of your work as a programmer.

== Installing OSIS

The first thing to do to start contributing to the project is to prepare the
development environment. During this section, we explain in details how to do
that in a Debian-based distribution (Debian Linux, Ubuntu, Mint, etc.). This is
the recommended operating system for development and deployment.

If your operating system is not based on Debian Linux then you can rely on a
virtual machine as a development environment. For the virtual machine, we
suggest  https://www.virtualbox.org[VirtualBox] as virtual runtime and
https://ubuntu-mate.org[Ubuntu Mate] as operating system. Follow the
installation instructions on their respective websites according to your own
platform. When the Ubuntu virtual machine is created and running, execute the
following command to make the operating system aware of the virtual runtime:

    $ sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-x11

Now that you have a Debian-based Linux system available, you can start preparing
the development environment in it. Follow the steps below:

- <<installing-git>>
- <<installing-postgresql>>
- <<installing-couchbase>>
- <<installing-django>>
- <<installing-application>>

[[installing-git]]
=== Installing and Configuring Git

Git is a distributed version control system used to manage the source code of
OSIS. The source code is necessary to develop and deploy OSIS and we start the
instructions by explaining how to install and configure it. We can use `apt-get`
to install Git:

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install git

The `update` command downloads package lists from remote repositories to get
information about the newest versions of packages and their dependencies. This
way, we make sure we are getting the last version of Git and all other
dependencies. Then `install git` performs the installation. We can test it by
cloning the repository:

    $ mkdir -p ~/python/projects/osis
    $ cd ~/python/projects/osis
    $ git clone git@github.com:uclouvain/osis.git

Next, we add some personal information in the local Git installation to make
sure you are well identified in all commits:

    $ git config --global user.name "[Firstname] [Lastname]"
    $ git config --global user.email "[firstname.lastname]@domain.com"

Since version 2.0, Git has adopted a new behavior to pull and push commits while
in a branch. When you execute `git push` or `git pull` Git will consider pushing
or pulling just for the current branch. Before, these commands would push and
pull all branches. But the change to this new behavior is voluntary, not
automatically imposed. So, we have to explicitly say we have to move from the
old behavior to the new one. To do that, execute the following command:

    $ git config --global push.default simple

=== Configuring Git to Simplify GitHub Authentication

For the moment, every time we push code to GitHub the prompt asks for a username
and password. We can bypass this step by registering a SSH key. To do that, we
first check whether there is already an existing SSH key we can reuse:

    $ ls -al ~/.ssh

If files with the extension `.pub` are listed then one of them can be reused to
authenticate to GitHub. If not, then we can create one:

    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "[firstname.lastname]@domain.com"
      Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/[user]/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]
      Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
      Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]

The next step is to add the new key - or an existing one - to the `ssh-agent`.
This program runs the duration of a local login session, stores unencrypted keys
in memory, and communicates with SSH clients using a Unix domain socket.
Everyone who is able to connect to this socket also has access to the ssh-agent.
First, we have to enable the ssh-agent:

    $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

And add key to it:

    $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

The next step is to make GitHub aware of the key. For that, we have to copy the
exact content of the file `id_rsa.pub` and paste into GitHub. To make no mistake
about the copy, install a program called `xclip`:

    $ sudo apt-get install xclip

And then copy the content of the file `id_rsa.pub` in the clipboard:

    $ xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

The command above is the equivalent of opening the file `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`,
selecting the whole content and pressing `Ctrl+C`. This way, you can paste the
content on GitHub when required in the next steps. On the GitHub side:

 . Login at https://github.com
 . In the top right corner of the page, click on the profile photo and select
   **Settings**
 . In the user settings sidebar, click **SSH keys**
 . Then click **Add SSH key**
 . In the form, define a friendly title for the new key and paste the key in the
   **Key** field
 . Click **Add Key** to finish with GitHub

To make sure everything is working, lets test the connection:

    $ ssh -T git@github.com
      The authenticity of host 'github.com (207.97.227.239)' can't be established.
      RSA key fingerprint is 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48.
      Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
      _
      Hi [username]! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not
      provide shell access.

This configuration works only when we use a ssh connection to GitHub. To verify
that, go to one of your local GitHub projects and check the url pointing to the
server:

    $ cd ~/python/projects/osis/osis
    $ git remote -v

If the url starts with `https://` then you are using `https` instead of `ssh`.
In this case, you should change the url to the ssh one:

    $ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:uclouvain/osis.git

The automatic authentication should work after that.

[[installing-postgresql]]
=== Installing and Configuring PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is the only database supported by OSIS. In theory, the Django ORM
would make the application database-independent, but we do not test OSIS with
other databases, thus we cannot guarantee that it works on other databases such
as MySQL or Oracle. Fortunately, PostgreSQL has a very good reputation, a large
community and a generous documentation.

TIP: If you really need a database different from PostgreSQL then you could
contribute to the project by testing OSIS on your favorite database.

Execute the following commands to install PostgreSQL:

    $ sudo apt-get install postgresql
    $ sudo su - postgres -c "createuser -s $USER"
    $ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev

The first command installs PostgreSQL and creates a user named after the current
logged OS user. The library libpq-dev is also installed for development purposes.

=== Creating the Database

Before moving forward, make sure you installed PostgreSQL, as explained in the
section <<installing-postgresql>>. Then, follow the steps below to create the
backend database:

    $ createdb osis_backend_dev
    $ createuser osis_usr -P    // Inform the password 'osis' when asked for.
    $ psql -d osis_backend_dev
      =# grant connect on database osis_backend_dev to osis_usr;
      =# revoke connect on database osis_backend_dev from public;
      =# \q

Now, install the necessary dependencies to allow a Python application to connect
to PostgreSQL:

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-dev libpq-dev

[[installing-couchbase]]
=== Installing CouchBase

    $ wget http://packages.couchbase.com/clients/c/libcouchbase-2.5.7_ubuntu1404_amd64.tar
    $ tar -xf libcouchbase-2.5.7_ubuntu1404_amd64.tar
    $ cd libcouchbase-2.5.7_ubuntu1404_amd64
    $ sudo dpkg -i libcouchbase2-core_2.5.7-1_amd64.deb
    $ sudo dpkg -i libcouchbase2-bin_2.5.7-1_amd64.deb
    $ sudo dpkg -i libcouchbase-dev_2.5.7-1_amd64.deb

[[installing-django]]
=== Installing and Configuring Django

Django is a modern and lightweight web framework to support our back office and
front office applications. The choice for Django was made thanks to the
following advantages:

- Very well documented.
- The most popular web framework on the Python ecosystem. Largely supported by
  the majority of platforms, IDEs and web servers in general.
- It supports several databases: Oracle, PortgreSQL, MySQL, etc.
- Most of the time, modifications in the code can be immediately seen on the
  browser, without the need for redeployments or restarts.
- Easily testable with Selenium.
- In general, more productive than most of the alternatives.

The repository `osis` is a Django application. We already cloned that when
installing git. At that point we executed the following commands:

    $ cd ~/python/projects/osis
    $ git clone git@github.com:uclouvain/osis.git

Install the Python virtual environment and other system dependencies:

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential, python-virtualenv libjpeg-dev libpng-dev

In the new repository, create a virtual environment to isolate all dependencies
of the project:

    $ cd osis
    $ virtualenv --python=python3.4 venv

[[installing-application]]
=== Installing the Application

Start the virtual environment and install the dependencies:

    $ source venv/bin/activate
    (venv)$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Create the data structure in the database:

    (venv)$ python manage.py migrate

At this point we have two options:

1. we create a super user and go on with an empty database or
2. we load the demonstration data that already contains a superuser

To create the super user and continue with an empty database:

    (venv)$ python manage.py createsuperuser
       Username (leave blank to use '[linux-user]'):
       Email address: your@emailaddress.com
       Password:
       Password (again):
       Superuser created successfully.

You will need this user to login on OSIS for the first time and be able to
create other users.

To load the demonstration data that already contains a superuser:

    (venv)$ python manage.py loaddata demo_data.json

The demonstration data create a super user with the following credentials:

    Username: osis
    Password: osisosis

The demonstration data also create several other users. The password for each
user is the username typed twice (e.g. user: `antonin`  password:
`antoninantonin`).

Now, we can run the application:

    (venv)$ python manage.py runserver

You can leave the server running while you are developing. It will take into
account all changes in your code, except the changes in the model. In this case,
we have to stop the server to execute the commands `makemigrations` and `migrate`
as shown above. When we have finished your daily work, we can deactivate the
virtual environment:

    (venv)$ deactivate

== Contributing to the Project

=== Following the Git Workflow

The code repository is organized in three fixed branches:

- *dev*: agregates developers' contributions that are intended to be in
  production, but they still need to be validated.
- *qa*: at the end of the sprint, when all features are frozen, the branch `dev`
  is merged into `qa` to allow testers to validate the release before it gets
  into production.
- *master*: once the version in `qa` is fully validated, it is merged into the
  branch `master`, which is the one to be deployed in production.

Developers should not commit directly to any of these branches. By convention,
these branches can only be changed if there is an issue in the
https://github.com/uclouvain/osis/issues[issue tracking tool] that justifies
the creation of an exclusive branch for that issue. For instance: if the
issue's number is `#234` then its respective branch is named `issue#234`,
created to isolate the changes described in the issue. To create a new branch
for the issue, perform the following commands:

    $ git checkout dev
    $ git pull origin dev
    $ git checkout -b issue#234

The first command enters in the branch `dev`, if the developer is not already in
there. Within the branch `dev`, the latest commits in the remote branch
`origin/dev` are downloaded and merged within the local branch `dev`. Then, the
new branch `issue#234` is created from the local branch `dev`.

The developer in charge of the issue `#234` changes the code within the branch
`issue#234`. Two commands are very useful to keep track of what has been done:

    $ git status
    $ git diff models.py

The first command shows all created, modified, removed and untracked files that
are candidates to be committed. The second shows the changes in one of the
modified files. When we are ready to commit, we should decide whether all
changed files will be included in the commit or just a subset of them. To
include all files:

    $ git commit -a -m "New entities added."

To include a subset of files, we have to add each file individually:

    $ git add base/models/academic_year.py
    $ git add base/models/academic_calendar.py
    $ git add base/models/__init__.py
    $ git commit -m "New entities added."

=== Creating and Working in a Branch

The issue tracker generates an incremental id that we can use to name branches.
It helps to keep branches linked to issues. For example: considering an issue
with the id 260, we can create a local branch with the following commands:

    $ git fetch origin dev
    $ git checkout dev
    $ git checkout -b issue#260

The first command updates the branch `dev` with the last changes on the server.
The second command moves from the branch we are at the moment to the branch
`dev`. The last command creates the branch `issue#260` from `dev` and
immediately moves to it. From this moment, every commit will be attached to the
correct branch. If the branch `dev` already exists in local, then instead of
fetching it we should pull it:

    $ git pull origin dev

Committing often is encouraged. All commits are done locally, thus there is no
risk of conflicts until all commits are sent to the server. The `push` option
sends all commits in a local branch to the server, identified by `origin`.

    $ git push origin issue#260

==== Fixing Mistakes

Version control doesn’t always happens smoothly. We will certainly face some
problems and fortunately Git is very gentile on which concerns recovering from
mistakes. These are some common situations we may face during development.

===== Moving to another branch before finishing the work in the current branch

Sometimes we are working in a branch and a more urgent problem arrives,
requiring us to move to or create another branch. In this case, we have to
commit all changes in the current branch before moving to another one, otherwise
we risk to have our changes to the current branch committed in another branch.
So, first add your changes and commit:

    $ git commit -a -m "New entities added but still incomplete."

and then move to an existing branch:

    $ git checkout issue#261

or create another branch from `dev`:

    $ git checkout dev
    $ git checkout -b issue#261

It also happens that we start fixing an issue but we forget to move to its
respective branch. In this case, we have to commit the files related to the
current branch and leave in the workspace the changes related to another branch:

    $ git add calendar.py
    $ git commit -m "Sort algorithm started."
    $ git checkout issue#260

The files that were not committed in the previous branch will be available for
commit in the branch issue#260.

This practical approach of moving from a branch to another while leaving some
files uncommitted may not work if at least one of the files we have changed
locally was also changed remotely. We may see a message like this:

    From https://github.com/uclouvain/osis
    * branch            dev        -> FETCH_HEAD
    Updating 57c4a6d..9839a25
    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten
           by merge:
           __openerp__.py
    Please, commit your changes or stash them before you can merge.
    Aborting

In this case, we have to commit local changes before moving to another branch.
But things can get worse because the current branch might be actually related to
a closed issue, thus committing to it doesn't make sense anymore. In this case,
we can use `git stash`. It moves all changes in the current workspace to a
transit area that can be recovered later on. To move all changes to the stash
area, simply type :

    $ git stash

Now, if we type `git status` we find the working directory clean, which means we
can move to another branch. To see the stashes we have stored we can use:

    $ git stash list

After moving to another branch, we can recover the changes from the stash are
using:

    $ git stash apply

but if there is more than one stash in the list we can apply a specific one by
referencing its identifier:

    $ git stash apply stash@{2}

== Fixing the latest commit message

    $ git commit --amend -m "message"

When we work with branches it’s very common to fool with the commits. There are
many branches locally and sometimes we forget to switch to the branch related to
the issue and we end up committing on the wrong branch. When it happens before
pushing the commits to the server, we can undo the last commit done with the
command:

    $ git reset --soft HEAD~1

But if the commit was already pushed to the server, it is still possible to undo
the push as long as other people have not pushed to the same branch after the
wrong push. It is done with the following command:

    $ git push origin master -f

Stop tracking a file without deleting it locally:

    $ git rm --cached [file]

Deleting remote branches:

    $ git push origin --delete test

== Adding the license to the source code

OSIS is an open source project licensed under GPL v3. As such, it must respect
certain rules of the license. The most important one is the addition of a
license header in each one of the source files.

For Python files, the following text should appear on the top of the file,
before any Python code:

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

=== Making changes in the model
